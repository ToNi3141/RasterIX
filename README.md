# About this Project
The Rasterix project is a rasterizer implementation for FPGAs written in Verilog. It implements a mostly OpenGL 1.3 compatible fixed function pixel pipeline with a maximum of two TMUs and register combiners in hardware. The vertex pipeline is implemented in software.
The renderer is able to produce __100MPixel__ and __200MTexel__ at a clockspeed of 100MHz.

The project started as an experiment, how an 3D renderer can be implemented on an FPGA and has evolved to a core, which is capable to render complex 3D scenes. The long term goal of this project is to recreate an open source fixed function renderer compatible with OpenGL ES 1.1 and OpenGL 1.5 suitable for embedded devices like microcontrollers. 

# Area Usage
With a typical configuration, the core requires __around 11k LUTs__ on a Xilinx Series 7 device: 
  - 64 bit memory bus
  - 256px textures
  - 1 TMU
  - mip mapping
  - fix point interpolation with 25 bit multipliers
  - internal framebuffer (RRXIF)

The core can blow up to __around 36k LUTs__ on a Xilinx Series 7 device when everything is enabled: 
  - 128 bit memory bus
  - 256px textures
  - 2 TMUs
  - mip mapping
  - float interpolation with 32 bit floats
  - external frame buffer (RRXEF)

Note: The float interpolation has the highest impact on the utilization and is usually not needed. Both configurations have the same behavior via the OpenGL API.

# Platforms
The rasterizer is running on the following platforms:

- [Verilator Simulation](/rtl/top/Verilator/README.md)
- [Digilent Nexys Video](/rtl/top/Xilinx/NexysVideo/README.md)
- [Digilent CMod7](/rtl/top/Xilinx/CmodA7/README.md)

# How to integrate
To integrate it into your own project, first have a look at the already existing platforms. If you want to integrate it in a already existing SoC system, you may have a look at the ArtyZ7. If you want to use it as standalone, have a look at the Nexys Video or CMod7.

The __pico-sdk__ and __PlatformIO__ are supported. See [Digilent CMod7](/rtl/top/Xilinx/CmodA7/README.md).

## How to port the Driver
To port the driver to a new interface (like SPI, async FT245, AXIS, or others) use the following steps:
1. Create a new class which is derived from the `IBusConnector`. Implement the virtual methods. This interface is used to interface the hardware via SPI, AXIS or what else.
2. Create a new class which is derived from the `IThreadRunner`. Implement the virtual methods or use one of the existing runners. This interface is used to offload work into a worker thread. Offloading has only an advantage on multi core systems. Single core systems will run slower. The `SingleThreadRunner` can be used for all platforms. It does not create an additional thread. The `MultiThreadRunner` can be used for systems which implement `std::async`. If you have another multi core system like the rppico, an own runner to utilize all cores needs to be implemented.
3. Set the build variables mentioned below in the table.
4. Add the whole `lib/gl`, `lib/3rdParty` and `lib/driver` directory to your build system. If a existing runner is used, also add `lib/utils`. If CMake is used, add this repository to your CMake project and include the library by adding `gl` (and `utils` when using an existing runner).
5. Build

See also the example [here](/example/util/native/Runner.hpp).

The build system requires the following parameters to be set:

Note: Bold options are required to be equal to the hardware counterparts.

|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| __RRX_CORE_TMU_COUNT__                 | Number of TMUs the hardware supports. Must be equal to the FPGA configuration. |
| __RRX_CORE_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE__          | The maximum texture resolution the hardware supports. A valid values is 256 for 256x256px textures. Must be the same value as in __MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE__ |
| __RRX_CORE_ENABLE_MIPMAPPING__         | Set this to `true` when mip mapping is available. Must be equal to the FPGA configuration |
| RRX_CORE_MAX_DISPLAY_WIDTH             | The maximum width if the screen. All integers are valid like 1024. To be most memory efficient, this should fit to your display resolution. |
| RRX_CORE_MAX_DISPLAY_HEIGHT            | The maximum height of the screen. All integers are valid like 600. To be most memory efficient, this should fit to your display resolution. |
| __RRX_CORE_FRAMEBUFFER_SIZE_IN_PIXEL_LG__ | The log2(size) of the framebuffer in pixel. For the `rrxef` variant, use a value which fits at least the whole screen like log2(1024 * 600) + 1. For the `rrxif` variant, use the same value configured in the FPGA. A valid value could be 16. |
| __RRX_CORE_USE_FLOAT_INTERPOLATION__   | If `true`, it uploads triangle parameters in floating point format. If `false`, it uploads triangle parameters in fixed point format. Must be equal to the FPGA configuration. |
| RRX_CORE_NUMBER_OF_TEXTURE_PAGES       | The number of texture pages available. Combined with TEXTURE_PAGE_SIZE, it describes the size of the texture memory on the FPGA. This must never exceed the FPGAs available memory. |
| RRX_CORE_NUMBER_OF_TEXTURES            | Number of allowed textures. Lower value here can reduce the CPU utilization. Typically set this to the same value as NUMBER_OF_TEXTURE_PAGES. |
| __RRX_CORE_TEXTURE_PAGE_SIZE__         | The size of a texture page in bytes. Typical value is 4096. |
| RRX_CORE_GRAM_MEMORY_LOC               | Offset for the memory location. Typically this value is 0. Can be different when the memory is shared with other hardware, like in the Zynq platform. |
| RRX_CORE_COLOR_BUFFER_LOC_0            | Location of the used framebuffer, when the RRX is off. On linux, usually the address of the buffer used for the fb dev. |
| RRX_CORE_COLOR_BUFFER_LOC_1            | Location of the first framebuffer. |
| RRX_CORE_COLOR_BUFFER_LOC_2            | Location of the second framebuffer. |
| RRX_CORE_DEPTH_BUFFER_LOC              | Location of the depth buffer (unused in `rrxif`). |
| RRX_CORE_STENCIL_BUFFER_LOC            | Location of the stencil buffer (unused in `rrxif`). |
| RRX_CORE_THREADED_RASTERIZATION        | Will run the rasterization in the display list upload thread. Can improve the performance by around 10%. |
| RRX_CORE_ENABLE_VSYNC                  | Enables vsync. Requires two framebuffers and a display hardware, which supports the vsync signals. |

## How to use the Core
1. Add the files in the following directories to your project: `rtl/Rasterix/*`, `rtl/3rdParty/verilog-axi/*`, `rtl/3rdParty/verilog-axis/*`, `rtl/3rdParty/*.v`, and `rtl/Float/rtl/float/*`.
2. Instantiate the `RRX` module and configure it.
3. Connect the `s_cmd_axis` interface to your command stream (this is the output from the `IBusConnector`).
4. Connect the `m_mem_axi` interface to a memory.
5. Optionally connect `m_framebuffer_axis` to an device, which can handle the color buffer stream (a display for instance). When using a memory mapped framebuffer, then this port is unused.
6. Connect the framebuffer signals (`swap_fb`, `fb_swapped`, `fb_addr`, `swap_fb_enable_vsync`). They are used to signal an display controller, that it should swap the color buffer. `swap_fb` gets high when a swapping is requested, `fb_swapped` is used to signal that the swap request was executed and the new color buffer is used. `fb_addr` contains the address of the new color buffer. Optionally `swap_fb_enable_vsync` informs the framebuffer to use vsync if available. If the signals are not used, then connect them the following way: `assign fb_swapped = !swap_fb`. `fb_addr` and `swap_fb_enable_vsync` can be left unconnected.
7. Connect `resetn` to your reset line and `aclk` to your clock domain.
8. Synthesize.

The hardware has the following configuration options:

Note: Bold options are required to be equal to the software counterparts.

# Variant
The core comes in two pre configured variants, `RRXIF` and `RRXEF`. `IF` stands for internal framebuffer while `EF` stands for external framebuffer. Both variants have their advantages and drawbacks. But except of the framebuffer handling and resulting limitations, they are completely equal.

`RRXIF`: This variant is usually faster, because it only loosely depends on the memory subsystem of your FPGA. The rendering is completely executed in the FPGAs static RAM resources. The drawback is the occupation of a lot of RAM resources on the FPGA and on your host.
For a reasonable performance, you need at least 128kB + 128kB + 32kB = 288kB memory only for the framebuffers. Less is possible but only useful for smaller displays. More memory is generally recommended.

The used memory is decoupled from the actual framebuffer size. If a framebuffer with a specific resolution won't fit into the internal framebuffer, then the framebuffer is rendered in several cycles where the internal framebuffer only contains a part of the whole framebuffer.

Because the framebuffer is split in several smaller ones, the host requires a display list for each partial framebuffer and must keep the display list in memory, until the rendering is done. For a picture with a reasonable complexity, you can assume that the host requires several MB of memory just for the display lists. It also can screw up the rendering in some cases. When a new frame without glClear is drawn, you will not see the echo of the last frame, instead you will see the echo of the last partial frame.

`RRXEF`: The performance of this variant heavily depends on the performance of your memory subsystem, because all framebuffers are on your system memory (typically DRAM). While the latency is not really important for the performance, but the the number of memory request the system can handle is even more. This is especially in the Xilinx MIG a big bottleneck for this design (because of this, it is around ~3 times slower that the `RRXIF`). Another limitation of the memory subsystem / AXI bus (the strobe of the AXI bus works only byte wise, not bit wise): Stencil and color masks are not working correctly and the color buffer does not support an alpha channel.

The advantages are: It doesn't use FPGA memory resources for the framebuffers. They are free for other designs, but it needs a bit more additional logic to handle the memory requests. Another advantage is the usage of smaller display list with intermediate display list uploads. That reduces the memory footprint for the display lists on the host system to a few kB. It isn't anymore required to keep the whole frame in the display list, the display list now acts only as a buffer. This configuration works more like a traditional renderer.

Both variants can work either in fixed point or floating point arithmetic. The fixed point arithmetic has almost the same image quality and compatibility compared to the float arithmetic. All tested games are working perfectly fine with both, while the fixed point configuration only requires half of the logic of the floating point configuration.
