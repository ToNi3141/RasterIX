# About this Project
The RasterIX* project is a rasterizer implementation for FPGAs written in Verilog. It implements a mostly OpenGL 1.3-compatible fixed-function pixel pipeline with up to two TMUs and register combiners in hardware. The vertex pipeline is implemented in software.

The renderer is able to produce __100 MPixels__ and __200 MTexels__ per second at a clock speed of 100 MHz.

The project began as an experiment to see how a 3D renderer could be implemented on an FPGA and has evolved into a core capable of rendering complex 3D scenes. The long-term goal of this project is to recreate an open-source fixed-function renderer compatible with OpenGL ES 1.1 and OpenGL 1.5, suitable for embedded devices such as microcontrollers or embedded Linux systems.

*The name RasterIX is an abbreviation of "Rasterizer 9", with the 9 referencing the end of the 1990s â€” a time when fixed-function renderers reached the peak of their popularity.

# Area Usage
With a typical configuration, the core requires __around 11k LUTs__ on a Xilinx Series 7 device: 
  - 64 bit memory bus
  - 256px textures
  - 1 TMU
  - mip mapping
  - depth buffer
  - stencil buffer
  - fog
  - texture filtering
  - RGB666
  - fix point interpolation with 25 bit multipliers
  - internal framebuffer (RasterIX_IF)

The core can blow up to __around 36k LUTs__ on a Xilinx Series 7 device when everything is enabled: 
  - 128 bit memory bus
  - 256px textures
  - 2 TMUs
  - mip mapping
  - depth buffer
  - stencil buffer
  - fog
  - texture filtering
  - RGB666
  - float interpolation with 32 bit floats
  - external frame buffer (RasterIX_EF)

A minimal configuration can get the utilization down to __around 4.5k LUTs__ on a Xilinx Series 7 device:
  - 32bit memory bus
  - 128px textures
  - 1 TMU
  - no mip mapping
  - no depth buffer
  - no stencil buffer
  - no fog
  - no texture filtering
  - RGB555
  - fix point interpolation with 25bit multipliers
  - internal framebuffer (RasterIX_IF)

Note: The float interpolation has the highest impact on the utilization and is usually not needed. Both configurations have the same behavior via the OpenGL API.

# Platforms
The rasterizer is running on the following platforms:

- [Verilator Simulation](/rtl/top/Verilator/README.md)
- [Digilent Nexys Video](/rtl/top/Xilinx/NexysVideo/README.md)
- [Digilent CMod7](/rtl/top/Xilinx/CmodA7/README.md)
- [Digilent ArtyZ7-20](/rtl/top/Xilinx/ArtyZ7-20/README.md)

# How to integrate
To integrate it into your own project, first have a look at the already existing platforms. If you want to integrate it in a already existing SoC system, you may have a look at the ArtyZ7. If you want to use it as standalone, have a look at the Nexys Video or CMod7.

The __pico-sdk__ and __PlatformIO__ are supported. See [Digilent CMod7](/rtl/top/Xilinx/CmodA7/README.md).

## How to port the Driver
To port the driver to a new interface (like SPI, async FT245, AXIS, or others) use the following steps:
1. Create a new class which is derived from the `IBusConnector`. Implement the virtual methods. This interface is used to interface the hardware via SPI, AXIS or what else.
2. Create a new class which is derived from the `IThreadRunner`. Implement the virtual methods or use one of the existing runners. This interface is used to offload work into a worker thread. Offloading has only an advantage on multi core systems. Single core systems will run slower. The `NoThreadRunner` can be used for all platforms. It does not create an additional thread. The `MultiThreadRunner` can be used for systems which implement `std::thread`. If you have another multi core system like the rppico, an own runner to utilize all cores must be implemented.
3. Set the build variables mentioned below in the table.
4. Add the whole `lib/gl`, `lib/3rdParty` and `lib/driver` directory to your build system. If a existing ThreadRunner is used, also add `lib/threadrunner`. If CMake is used, add this repository to your CMake project and include the library by adding `gl` (and `threadrunner` when using an existing runner).
5. Build

See also the example [here](/example/util/native/Runner.hpp).

The build system requires the following parameters to be set:

Note: Bold options are required to be equal to the hardware counterparts.

| __RIX_CORE_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE__          | The maximum texture resolution the hardware supports. A valid values is 256 for 256x256px textures. Must be the same value as in __MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE__ |
| __RIX_CORE_ENABLE_MIPMAPPING__         | Set this to `true` when mip mapping is available. Must be equal to the FPGA configuration |
| RIX_CORE_MAX_DISPLAY_WIDTH             | The maximum width if the screen. All integers are valid like 1024. To be most memory efficient, this should fit to your display resolution. |
| RIX_CORE_MAX_DISPLAY_HEIGHT            | The maximum height of the screen. All integers are valid like 600. To be most memory efficient, this should fit to your display resolution. |
| __RIX_CORE_FRAMEBUFFER_SIZE_IN_PIXEL_LG__ | The log2(size) of the framebuffer in pixel. For the `rixef` variant, use a value which fits at least the whole screen like log2(1024 * 600) + 1. For the `rixif` variant, use the same value configured in the FPGA. A valid value could be 16. |
| __RIX_CORE_USE_FLOAT_INTERPOLATION__   | If `true`, it uploads triangle parameters in floating point format. If `false`, it uploads triangle parameters in fixed point format. Must be equal to the FPGA configuration. |
| RIX_CORE_NUMBER_OF_TEXTURE_PAGES       | The number of texture pages available. Combined with TEXTURE_PAGE_SIZE, it describes the size of the texture memory on the FPGA. This must never exceed the FPGAs available memory. |
| RIX_CORE_NUMBER_OF_TEXTURES            | Number of allowed textures. Lower value here can reduce the CPU utilization. Typically set this to the same value as NUMBER_OF_TEXTURE_PAGES. |
| __RIX_CORE_TEXTURE_PAGE_SIZE__         | The size of a texture page in bytes. Typical value is 4096. |
| RIX_CORE_GRAM_MEMORY_LOC               | Offset for the memory location. Typically this value is 0. Can be different when the memory is shared with other hardware, like in the Zynq platform. |
| RIX_CORE_COLOR_BUFFER_LOC_0            | Location of the used framebuffer, when the RasterIX is off. On linux, usually the address of the buffer used for the fb dev. |
| RIX_CORE_COLOR_BUFFER_LOC_1            | Location of the first framebuffer. |
| RIX_CORE_COLOR_BUFFER_LOC_2            | Location of the second framebuffer. |
| RIX_CORE_DEPTH_BUFFER_LOC              | Location of the depth buffer (unused in `rixif`). |
| RIX_CORE_STENCIL_BUFFER_LOC            | Location of the stencil buffer (unused in `rixif`). |
| RIX_CORE_THREADED_RASTERIZATION        | Will run the rasterization and (in case of a `rixef`config) also the transformation in a thread. A threaded runner is required. Can significantly improve the performance of the vertex pipeline. |
| RIX_CORE_THREADED_RASTERIZATION_BUFFER_SIZE | Sets the size of the display list. Bigger lists are required for the IF config. The EF config allows smaller lists because if intermediate uploads. |
| RIX_CORE_ENABLE_VSYNC                  | Enables vsync. Requires two framebuffers and a display hardware, which supports the vsync signals. |

## How to use the Core
1. Add the files in the following directories to your project: `rtl/RasterIX/*`, `rtl/3rdParty/verilog-axi/*`, `rtl/3rdParty/verilog-axis/*`, `rtl/3rdParty/*.v`, and `rtl/Float/rtl/float/*`.
2. Instantiate the `RasterIX` module and configure it.
3. Connect the `s_cmd_axis` interface to your command stream (this is the output from the `IBusConnector`).
4. Connect the `m_mem_axi` interface to a memory.
5. Optionally connect `m_framebuffer_axis` to an device, which can handle the color buffer stream (a display for instance). When using a memory mapped framebuffer, then this port is unused.
6. Connect the framebuffer signals (`swap_fb`, `fb_swapped`, `fb_addr`, `swap_fb_enable_vsync`). They are used to signal an display controller, that it should swap the color buffer. `swap_fb` gets high when a swapping is requested, `fb_swapped` is used to signal that the swap request was executed and the new color buffer is used. `fb_addr` contains the address of the new color buffer. Optionally `swap_fb_enable_vsync` informs the framebuffer to use vsync if available. If the signals are not used, then connect them the following way: `assign fb_swapped = !swap_fb`. `fb_addr` and `swap_fb_enable_vsync` can be left unconnected.
7. Connect `resetn` to your reset line and `aclk` to your clock domain.
8. Synthesize.

The hardware has the following configuration options:

Note: Bold options are required to be equal to the software counterparts.

# Variant
The core comes in two variants: `RasterIX_IF` and `RasterIX_EF`. `IF` stands for internal framebuffer, while `EF` stands for external framebuffer. Both variants have their advantages and drawbacks, but except for framebuffer handling and resulting limitations, they are functionally identical.

`RasterIX_IF`: This variant is usually faster because it only loosely depends on the memory subsystem of your FPGA. Rendering is executed entirely in the FPGA's static RAM resources. The drawback is the occupation of significant RAM resources on both the FPGA and the host. For reasonable performance, you need at least 128kB + 128kB + 32kB = 288kB of memory just for the framebuffers. Less is possible but only useful for smaller displays; more memory is generally recommended.

The memory used is decoupled from the actual framebuffer size. If a framebuffer with a specific resolution does not fit into the internal framebuffer, it is rendered in several cycles, with the internal framebuffer containing only a part of the whole framebuffer.

Because the framebuffer is split into several smaller ones, the host requires a display list for each partial framebuffer and must keep the display list in memory until rendering is complete. For a picture with reasonable complexity, you can assume that the host requires several MB of memory just for the display lists. This can also cause rendering issues in some cases (for example, when no `glClear()` is called). No partial depth or stencil buffer is loaded into the FPGA SRAM; instead, only the clear color is loaded. As a result, you end up with a cleared framebuffer instead of the content from the last frame. The color buffer behaves differently: it loads the content of the partial color buffer from memory into the FPGA SRAM to continue drawing on the last framebuffer. Depth and stencil buffers are excluded from this mechanism because drawing with out clear is rarely used, and excluding them improves the performance of the IF variant.

`RasterIX_EF`: The performance of this variant heavily depends on the performance of your memory subsystem, because all framebuffers are stored in system memory (typically DRAM). While latency is not critical for performance, the number of memory requests the system can handle is much more important. This is a significant bottleneck for this design, especially with the Xilinx MIG (making it about three times slower than `RasterIX_IF`). Another limitation of the memory subsystem/AXI bus (the strobe of the AXI bus works only byte-wise, not bit-wise) is that stencil and color masks do not work correctly, and the color buffer does not support an alpha channel.

The advantages are that it does not use FPGA memory resources for the framebuffers, freeing them for other designs, though it requires additional logic to handle memory requests. Another advantage is the use of smaller display lists with intermediate display list uploads, reducing the memory footprint for display lists on the host system to a few kB. It is no longer necessary to keep the whole frame in the display list; the display list now acts only as a buffer. This configuration works more like a traditional renderer.

Both variants can operate in either fixed-point or floating-point arithmetic. The fixed-point arithmetic provides almost the same image quality and compatibility as floating-point arithmetic. All tested games work perfectly fine with both, while the fixed-point configuration requires only half the logic of the floating-point configuration.
